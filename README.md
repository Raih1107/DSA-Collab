# DSA-Collab
# 🧠 DSA Collaboration Tracker

Welcome to our collaborative repository for practicing Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)!  
This repo helps us assign problems, track progress, and submit solutions — all in one place.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Assign DSA problems to the group
- Track individual + group progress
- Tag problems by topic, difficulty, and platform
- Submit and review each other's solutions
- Build discipline and consistency together 💪






---

## ✅ How We Work

1. 🐛 **Create a new Issue** for every problem  
   - Include: title, topic, platform, difficulty, and a link  
   - Assign everyone (or relevant members)
   - Add it to the **Project Board**

2. 🔄 **Track your progress**  
   - Go to the [Project Board](./projects)  
   - Move tasks across: `To Do` → `In Progress` → `Solved by All`  
   - Update the custom field: `Solved By`

3. 💻 **Submit your solution**  
   - Inside the `/solutions` folder under topic
   - File name format: `problem_name_username.extension`  
   - Example: `two_sum_vinay.cpp`
